This is my personal collection of tests I'm using to verify the correct behavior of gdb on FreeBSD

This work is still in progress, a lot of work has to be done to get a really good test suite, but it's a good start point

KNOWN FAILURE
pthread-1 is not clear: it stops on gdb.
mthr-attach doesn't work: a thread is duplicated and the thread list is not really trustable
